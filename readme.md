Welcome to HarvestDecemberRenPy! This is a RenPy port of the 3DS VN "Harvest December", to the Nintendo Switch and PS Vita.

Work is starting now--it may be slow but I will update this readme with my progress.

I appreciate your continued interest in this project!

Happy reading!

UPDATE #1 -- 11/30/2021

Hello again!! I have done some work on the project, but have hit a major snag in the conversion of image, video, and sound files from the 3DS version into filetypes specified by the script (.png, .mp4, .wav).

I currently do not have a computer (that can install programs, I use a school-issued computer, and will be for the forseeable future) to convert the files from .bin and .moflex.

I have used hex editors to see if there are any commonalities with, for example, the .bin file that is specified as a .png, and couldn't find any (I was looking for a common header, and also tried injecting the .png header into the .bin). 

So I assume that a program-based converter is needed. If anyone is able to somehow help me with this (you will be credited if you'd like), please open an issue on the Issues tab, and I will get back to you with whatever I can provide.

For now, until the files are able to somehow be converted, I'll be working on converting the VN's script itself into a format readable by RenPy.

I hope your coming December is as magical as Masaki, Yuki, Shiro, Kouhei, Sanae, and Mizuho's was!

-takoyaki :)
