# Harvest December: Reharvested! Portable

## Project introduction by takoyaki99

Welcome to Harvest December: Reharvested: Portable!

This is a RenPy port of the 3DS (and iOS and PC) VN "Harvest December", to the Nintendo Switch and PS Vita. It uses Autumn Rivers' code! (they run Harvest December: Reharvested, a PC port of Harvest December, which is of course what this project is based off of)

Work is starting now--it may be slow but I will update this readme with my progress.



I appreciate your continued interest in this project!
