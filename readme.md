# Harvest December: Reharvested! Portable

[PROJECT ARCHIVED]

## PROJECT INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Harvest December: Reharvested: Portable!

This is a RenPy port of the 3DS (and iOS and PC) VN "Harvest December", to the Nintendo Switch and PS Vita. It uses Autumn Rivers' code! (they run Harvest December: Reharvested, a PC port of Harvest December, which is of course what this project is based off of!)

Ths VN is in the process of being ported! Vita first and hopefully Switch afterwards!

A big thank you to SilverCrow2323 for being a huge help with the port! Without his help this project wouldn't have been able to get running off the ground!

I appreciate your continued interest in this project!

## UPDATE HISTORY

- **UPDATE #5 -- 05/21/2022**

Hello!!

Not much right now. I'd like to apologize for the development basically slowing down a lot. My Switch broke so I can't really do much, including contact the other members of the project!! We're still working on the PS Vita and Switch ports, and I do want to say that the Vita version is still running beautifully~, and hopefully by the time I get it repaired we can get some progress on the Switch version as well!!

Thank you very much for waiting, I really appreciate your patience and effort, including the amazing effort put together by the other members of the team~!!


- **UPDATE #5 -- 04/10/2022**

Hello, here's SilverCrow!

We are happy to inform you that the work on the PSVITA Port is progressing with positive results! 

We would like to thank Autumn, developer of the PC Remake, who never denied us her precious help, responding to any of our appeals.

Speaking of the `Port for PSVITA` we can say that, after a few small improvements, already runs properly, so it's already possible to enjoy the complete story of the 3 Books available and taken from the PC Remake (the 4th book is in the works!).

The small problems still present and on which we are working are:

- **Videos**: in the PC version there are some `mkv` videos that made up the Opening and the Credits cutscenes, then contained in the `Cinema` section of the `Extra` menu (unlocked finishing the first Book).
Since there is no way to play them on `renpy-vita`, they will be replaced using the relative `OSTs` (tracks included in the `Extra` menu, section `Jukebox`).

- **Staff credits**: all the links integrated in the original `About` section are present but not working, in the sense that they will not be able to automatically open a window in the `PSVITA Browser` when selected.
To get around this problem will be added a dedicated section in the `Extra` menu, called (for the right) `Credits`, in which will be available all the needed `QR Codes` to reach those links with a simple smartphone!

Work continues! We will keep you updated.

- **UPDATE #4 -- 04/08/2022**

Hello, here's SilverCrow.

I got to know this VN thanks to takoyaki who contacted me in one of my Repositories, letting me know about this project and Autumn's work.

Afterwards she kindly passed me all the files of Autumn's work so I could have a better management of the project (also on Renpy SDK).

I must say that I'm finding this VN particularly interesting, really "lively" humour with an engaging story.

At the moment, with the indications and info provided by takoyaki, I tried to do some tests and to compile some raw ports of this PC Remake.

Currently the game seems to run correctly without any devastating problems, on the contrary. We may soon release a PSVITA Port, then moving onto the Switch Port when it is fully optimised.

If we need to, I hope we can release some patches to further improve the PSVITA experience.

Right now the only "issue" is a bit of lag during continuos text skips (overclocking not needed but suggested).

We'll keep you updated

- **UPDATE #3 -- 02/25/2022**

Hello for the third time! Small update here but--I have started (trying) to compile Autumn's port for the Switch version! The program I'm using doesn't want to work for whatever reason but I emailed the creator and am working on fixing it hopefully~! And as for the Vita version I saw that that one needs some more prerequisite programs, so that'll likely take a bit longer. I might need to make modifications to the Vita version depending on if the Vita version will crash or not in certain spots.

But with this please be assured that I am actively-ish working behind the scenes to make this project into a reality!!

I appreciate your interest in this project!

- **UPDATE #2 -- 02/04/2022**

Hello again (again)!! Thanks to the amazing Autumn Rivers I was able to acquire A LOT of the stuff that I need! They are running a project VERY similar to mine, and I'd like to thank them and link their project here. Because they are officially supporting me, I have also decided to use the George Henry Shaft translation that they use. Sometime I may work on formatting the 3DS's script to RenPy, but for now I'll try compiling what Autumn has given me! Thanks so much for your help, Autumn~ (and please check them out if you own a PC!!) https://natirivers.itch.io/harvest-december-remake https://nitter.net/natirivers

In the end--I do think and hope that things will pick up with this project! Yay~

I appreciate your continued interest!

- **UPDATE #1 -- 11/30/2021**

Hello again!! I have done some work on the project, but have hit a major snag in the conversion of image, video, and sound files from the 3DS version into filetypes specified by the script (.png, .mp4, .wav).

I currently do not have a computer (that can install programs, I use a school-issued computer, and will be for the forseeable future) to convert the files from .bin and .moflex.

I have used hex editors to see if there are any commonalities with, for example, the .bin file that is specified as a .png, and couldn't find any (I was looking for a common header, and also tried injecting the .png header into the .bin).

So I assume that a program-based converter is needed. If anyone is able to somehow help me with this (you will be credited if you'd like), please open an issue on the Issues tab, and I will get back to you with whatever I can provide.

For now, until the files are able to somehow be converted, I'll be working on converting the VN's script itself into a format readable by RenPy.

I hope your coming December is as magical as Masaki, Yuki, Shiro, Kouhei, Sanae, and Mizuho's was!
